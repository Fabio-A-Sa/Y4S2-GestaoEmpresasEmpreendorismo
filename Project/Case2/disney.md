The November 2019 launch brought the service to five countries and Western European markets opened in Spring 2020.

In August 2022, Disney+ was thinking about an ad-supported option at a lower price than the ad-free option that currently was at $7.99/month. Should they now move away from offering only "best-in-class".

Hulu had achieved a strong $30 CPM for ads in the ad-supported tier. Disney+ had this experience with Hulu ad-supported service and some people were saying that it would obtain an even higher CPM than Hulu.

__Q:__ If Disney+ were to introduce an ad-supported tier, how much advertising should it be inserting per hour? Hulu was about at 8 minutes per hour, far lower than conventional broadcast television, but HBO Max ad-supported was at only 4-5 minutes per hour of advertising.

### 3) How important is the Disney bundle offering? What's the logic behind it?

#### Disney Bundle:
Release in November 12 2019.
1) $13.99/month for all three: Disney+, ESPN+ and the ad-supported version of Hulu.
2) $19.99/month for all three: Disney+, ESPN+ and the ad-free version of Hulu.

Compared to Sum of Prices:
1) Disney+ at $6.99, ESPN+ at $4.99 and Hulu ad-supported at $6.99 = $18.97/month
2) Disney+ at $6.99, ESPN+ at $4.99 and Hulu ad-supported at $12.99 = $24.97/month

Disney Bundle abranges all the target audience of Disney in one package.

__Cost Efficiency__: The Disney bundle offers significant cost savings compared to subscribing to each service individually. For example, the bundle pricing of $13.99/month for all three services is substantially lower than the sum of individual prices ($18.97/month). This affordability makes the bundle appealing to budget-conscious consumers.

__Comprehensive Content__: By bundling Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu together, Disney provides a wide range of content catering to different interests and demographics. This comprehensive offering appeals to a broader audience and ensures that subscribers have access to a diverse selection of entertainment options, including family-friendly shows, sports coverage, and a variety of TV shows and movies.

__Target Audience Coverage__: The Disney bundle encompasses all segments of Disney's target audience in one package. This strategic move allows Disney to capture a larger market share by appealing to different consumer preferences and interests. For example, families may be drawn to Disney+ for its animated films and original content, sports enthusiasts to ESPN+ for live sports coverage, and individuals seeking a broader range of content to Hulu.

__Subscriber Retention__: The bundle offering encourages subscriber retention by providing added value and convenience. Subscribers are more likely to continue their subscription when they can access multiple services they enjoy through a single subscription package. This helps Disney maintain a stable subscriber base and reduce churn rates over time.

__Competitive Advantage__: The Disney bundle gives Disney a competitive edge in the streaming services market by offering a compelling value proposition that rivals may struggle to match. By combining three popular streaming services at an attractive price point, Disney strengthens its position in the market and solidifies its reputation as a leading provider of entertainment content.

__Cross-Promotion Opportunities__: The bundle enables cross-promotion and upselling opportunities among Disney's streaming platforms. For example, subscribers may be introduced to new content or services within the bundle that they wouldn't have considered otherwise. This cross-promotion strategy helps drive engagement and encourages subscribers to explore additional offerings within the Disney ecosystem

#
### 4) What are the key considerations (pros/cons) of introducing a Disney+ ad-supported service? Should Disney go for it?

Disney has Hulu experience with 70% of his customers' subscriptions on the ad-supported tier.

Disney+ out of the 3 Streaming Services, is the one with most profit. Due to its ad-free at lower price. Current moment at $7.99/month.

#### Adding a ad-supported tier:
__Pros__:
- __Expanded Audience Reach__: Introducing an ad-supported tier could attract a segment of customers who are price-sensitive or unwilling to pay for an ad-free subscription. This expands Disney's audience reach and allows them to tap into a larger market segment.
- __Additional Revenue Streams__: The ad-supported tier could generate additional revenue through advertising. By monetizing the content with ads, Disney can supplement subscription revenue and potentially increase overall profitability.
- __Pricing Flexibility__: Offering both ad-supported and ad-free tiers provides pricing flexibility, allowing customers to choose the option that best suits their preferences and budget. This could lead to higher overall customer satisfaction and retention.

__Cons__:
- __Potential Subscription Loss__: Introducing an ad-supported tier may cannibalize some of Disney's existing ad-free subscriptions. Customers who are currently paying for the ad-free experience may downgrade to the ad-supported tier to save money, resulting in a loss of subscription revenue.
- __Adverse Customer Experience__: Ads may disrupt the viewing experience for some subscribers, leading to dissatisfaction and potential churn. Customers accustomed to the ad-free experience may be deterred by the inclusion of ads and opt to cancel their subscriptions altogether.
- __Revenue Impact__: While the ad-supported tier could generate additional revenue from advertising, it's essential to consider the trade-off between ad revenue and potential subscription losses. Analyzing the net financial impact is crucial to determine if the introduction of the ad-supported tier is financially viable.
