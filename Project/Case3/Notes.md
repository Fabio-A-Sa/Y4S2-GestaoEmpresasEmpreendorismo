## Question 3

By looking at the financial statements for the past five years and analyzing their structure and evolution, evaluate the general trends in Tata Motors’ financial performance. The financial statements can be divided into:

– Balance sheet;
– Income statement;
– Statement of cash flows;

### 1 - Balance Sheet

It represents the organization’s property both in composition and in value. Assets = Equity + Liabilities, as shown in the balance sheet. By plotting the equity and liabilities graph over the past few years, it is concluded that, overall, there has been an increase in all sectors.

Liabilities are on a constant rise, whereas Equity has periods of decline, which is not ideal for the company.

However, for the first time in a decade, Tata Motors registered a negative growth in FY 2017, as evidenced by the analysis of the graph. This drastic decline occurred after changes in the market, with the implementation of Bharat Stage VI, the new automobile emission standard.

The company's plan involved structural cost reductions, sales enhancement, zero tolerance to delay in product launches, optimizing the supply base, and rapid ramp-up of capacity. This can be seen in the transition from 2017 to 2018, where we highlight three main points from the balance sheet:

- Drastic decrease in short-term investments: part of the proposed cost reduction;
- Property/Plant/Equipment: proposed zero tolerance to delay in product launches; having more infrastructure helps;
- Intangibles (gross): also increased significantly;

### Income Statement

A document that shows the results (profits or losses) in a certain financial period, for assessing the economic performance in the period. It identifies the revenues and expenses incurred during a given period.

After the decline in 2017, let's highlight the years 2015 (the highest positive balance in recent years), 2017 (a significant decrease due to the new market reality), and 2018 (a 17% increase from the previous year due to the new internal measures).

### Cash-Flow Statement

Cash inflows and outflows of the company demonstrate the organization's ability to generate cash.

– Receipts: entry of monetary values for the organization;
– Payments: outflow of monetary values from the organization;

We explore the evolution of cash flows in three scenarios:

- Cash from Operating Activities;
- Cash from Investing Activities;
- Cash from Financing Activities;

Cash from Operating Activities reached values as low as those observed in 2013, revealing the crisis the company faced starting in 2016.

Cash from Financing Activities fluctuates significantly over the years due to the dynamic market in this area and the successive implementation of laws requiring internal restructuring.

Cash from Investing Activities showed a significant drop from 2017 to 2018. This decrease aligns with the reduction in short-term investments as part of the proposed cost reduction.

In 2018, there was a 34% increase in the global cash flow compared to the same period in 2017.
