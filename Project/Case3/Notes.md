## Question 3

By looking at the financial statements for the past five years and analyzing their structure and evolution, evaluate the general trends in Tata Motors’ financial performance. The financial statements can be divided into:

– Balance sheet;
– Income statement;
– Statement of cash flows;

### 1 - Balance Sheet

It represents the organization’s property both in composition and in value. Assets = Equity + Liabilities, as shown in the balance sheet. By plotting the equity and liabilities graph over the past few years, it is concluded that, overall, there has been an increase in all sectors.

However, for the first time in a decade, Tata Motors registered a negative growth in FY 2017, as evidenced by the analysis of the graph. This drastic decline occurred after changes in the market, with the implementation of Bharat Stage VI, the new automobile emission standard.

The company's plan involved structural cost reductions, sales enhancement, zero tolerance to delay in product launches, optimizing the supply base, and rapid ramp-up of capacity. This can be seen in the transition from 2017 to 2018, where we highlight three main points from the balance sheet:

- Drastic decrease in short-term investments: part of the proposed cost reduction;
- Property/Plant/Equipment: proposed zero tolerance to delay in product launches; having more infrastructure helps;
- Intangibles (gross): also increased significantly;

### Income Statement

A document that shows the results (profits or losses) in a certain financial period, for assessing the economic performance in the period. It identifies the revenues and expenses incurred during a given period.

Explorar:

Revenues: ver onde eles ganham mais rendimentos

Expenses: ver onde eles gastam mais

E calcular, para cada ano, o que sobra (Revenues - Expenses), gráfico da evolução das variáveis ao longo do tempo. Depois disso, nem tudo é receita, aprofundar de acordo com o significado das variáveis. Se eles estão a diminuir a receita total (que estão), mas a colocar o dinheiro para impulsionar a empresa, é bom sinal.

### Cash-Flow Statement

Fluxos de caixa. Cash inflows and outflows of the company. Demonstrates the organization's ability to generate cash.

– Receipts (recebimentos): entry of monetary values for the organization.
– Payments (pagamentos): outflow of monetary values from the organization.

Explorar o Cash flow de acordo com os três tópicos:

- Cash from Operating Activities
- Cash from Investing Activities
- Cash from Financing Activities

Fazer um gráfico com a evolução (vai ser mais complicado, há um que está sempre negativo, e outro que começa negativo e passa a positivo -> bom sinal).

No final, somar tudo e encontrar uma justificação plausível.
