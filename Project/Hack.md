# Freeshippo case study

## How would you characterize in detail Freshippo’s product-market fit and the way it evolved throughout time?

### Custumer segments

#### Custumer Archetype
Target Audience
* 20-to-45 year-old female white-collar workers who use AliPay

Caracteristics of the target audience
* Have families to take care of
* Lived a fast-paced life
* Enjoy moderate to high spending power
* Quality of live is crucial to them
* Users were limited between online and offline , but lacked convenience in both ways.
* Are influenced by friends / other custumers mainly  through social media. (freshippo gained a good amount of clients that way. Since people liked their services they started to recommend it to others).

#### Job-to-be-done

* Make shopping more convenient and enjoyable for customers.
* Fresh food, mainly seafood was not found very often. (client need)
* Lunches of office workers have 2 main problems: food hygiene and long time wasted on queues. (problem)

#### Customer Workflow

An example of a potential client

1. User goes to work early, sometimes without having a proper breakfast
2. User has breakfast in, e.g., a normal caffé, and wastes long times on queues
3. User works until lunch time
4. User must face similar problems at lunch time
5. User works again until late
6. User does not have much time to go to the supermarket and end up buying things in a hurry, not having time to look for everything they need.
7. User has to carry their groceries home after a long day of work.

#### Current Solutions

* Use local restaurants and caffés to eat.
* Use general supermarkets.
* Use online e-commerce platforms like AliBaba.


### Value propositions

* Brick-and-Mortar stores -  Convenience, freshness, quality.
    * fresh food cooked in store to eat on the spot.
    * user can, through an app, buy groceries at the store and order someone to deliver the goods  to his/her place. (unique feature).
    * Focus on fresh food and healthy diets. (specialized to the target audience).
* Online platforms - Time saving, variety.
    * Application gives you some advantages and it is used to pay all the products (metric to keep the clients).
    * Freeshippo Cloud Supermarkets - Selected top products that the audience would also like to buy but were not available at the brick-and-mortar stores.
* F2 stores
    * have breakfast / lunch / afternoon tea.
    * place orders via the App
    * Workers could go to the store to pick the food in a scheduled time or eat on the spot
    * F2 stores were positioned in strategic areas (next to client's workspace)
    * Stores with 500m2
* Hexioma stores
    * //TODO
* Freshippo Naxshiang Store
    * restaurant and market all at one completly automated  store with robots cooking some of the food. Created to solve long queue waiting time.

### Evolution of product-market fit

firstly only brick-and-mortar stores were created based on the target audience. Then, other studies were done and problems around breakfast and lunch of office workers were found. This lead to the creation of the F2 stores. Using big data, freeshippo could also know products that were very likely to be bought by the target audience. In response they created the Freeshippo cloud supermarket. Finnaly after receiving a lot of complains about the long time wainting on queues at F2 stores the Freshippo Naxshiang Store was created.
