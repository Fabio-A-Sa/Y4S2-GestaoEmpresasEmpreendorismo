# Freeshippo study case

## Idea : what is freeshippo

Without freeshippo custumers could only choose between supermarket and e-commerce platforms.
Freeshippo gives the custumers some advantages:
* fresh food cooked in store to eat on the spot
* By scanning QR code, the user could ask the app to carry the groceries home
* Users can place orders online (as regular e-commerce platforms)

## Business model inovation

* Technology - helped freeshippo to collect big data from interaction with users, product locations ...
* Cloud computing - Built system around Ali Cloud
* Big Data and AI - established a set of unified standards in terms of membership systems, product prices, inventory, marketing channels ...

> Question: Would Freeshippo benefit with the use of 5g?

## Data-Driven Bussiness Model

### First iteration

Freeshippo initial KPI
* Revenue online > revenue offline
* Each Store must have more that 5k daily orders online
* The app should be able to survive independently without support from other online traffic
* Stores offer 30-minute delivery while keeping logistics cost under control

Target Audience
* 20-to-45 year-old female white-collar workers who use AliPay

Caracteristics of the target audience
* Have families to take care of
* Lived a fast-paced life
* Enjoy moderate to high spending power
* Quality of live is crucial to them

> How to make target audience stay in the freeshippo app? \
 -> Based on target audience characteristics the app offered fresh seafood and healfy diets. Once they approved the products, they would then use freshippo for all groceries in general.


Since it could not be found fresh seafood elsewhere people really enjoyed these products.
Satisfied clients spread the word on social media and freeshippo gained popularity.

### Second iteration
Studies influence the creation of F2 stores, Freeshippo Cloud Supermarket and Hexiaoma Stores.

#### F2 stores
Pain points around breakfast and lunch of office workers (other target audience):
* food hygiene
* long time wasted in queues

F2 stores allow users to:
* have breakfast / lunch / afternoon tea.
* place orders via the App
* Workers could go to the store to pick the food in a scheduled time or eat on the spot

F2 stores were positioned in strategic areas (next to client's workspace)
Stores with 500m2

#### Freeshippo Cloud Supermarket
After analysing big data, they selected the top products that the target audience would also like to buy but that were not available at the brick-and-mortar stores.

It was found that the target audience only cared about fast deliveries when they were not concerned with the price.

#### Hexioma
* stores with 800m2
* fresh products still priority and occupy 50% of the stores.
* only promissed delivery within an hour and only free on the first order.
* Combined experience in data-driven operations and store managenemt

### 3rd iteration

Freeshippo was widely criticized for the long wait time for meals.
They open Freshippo Naxshiang Store, that was a restaurant and a market all in one.
All the management of the restaurant was automated, robots were used to deliever food and system was used to keep the clients orders. The robots even cooked some of the dishes and only took 40 seconds to deliever an order once it was ready.

Complains about lackluster food. The problem with the time was not completly mitigated.

## Data-Driven Core Competencies

### Site selection

The site for the new store was chosed after analysing Alipay user information via AliPay itself or 3rd party platforms.
Taken into account:
* Number of online shoppers
* online transaction volume
* local real-estate companies would help them? (not taken from Alipay info i guess xD)

What other companies did:
* Build a store in a central area (not the best approach)

### Online Traffic Guided by Brick-and-Mortar Stores

Ultimate goal was to guide custumers to shop on the app, boosting online traffic.
The app was crucial to transform offline traffic to online traffic.
How does it happened?
* use the app to pay in offline stores
* custumers could use the app to scan products barcodes in-store and place orders online for home delivery.
* check-out machine via app scanning feature.
* If the client ordered food from the dinner area, the app would give a notification to them when the food was ready.

conclusion: app became something important even for offline users.

### Personalized marketing

Using big data available and making big profiles over their custumers they were able to recommend the best products to the right people. Also different types of promotions online helped on this requirement.

### Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain was managed with new technology and equipement.
Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) was developed around the Alibaba Cloud Platform.
Use of deep learning techniques to enhance the Supply Chain operations.

## Data-Driven Product Selection
Again selected based on AliPay big data.
After 2 months of opening a store, Freeshippo traked the sales of each SKU to see what were the products that must be stocked.

> Why 2 months? \
-> It was the "conversion" time of the custumers' ordering patterns.

Freeshippo created private-label brands.
Products under the private-label brands were purchased through the "buyers system" directly to production bases.
"Daily fresh" products were purchased via the supply chain that was built with local farms.

Products of 3rd-party brands were selected via big data analysis. To make prices more reasonable they do not charge entry fees, and so on.

## Warehouse Management

2 levels:
* Central Warehouse
    * Quality inspection
    * Product Standardization
    * Live Seafood Farming
    * Products delivered in bulk on pallets
* Store Warehouse
    * Responsible to get the "daily fresh" products
    * Products delivered in small packages

Warehouse management was also built on top of Alibaba systems.
Freeshippo invented a real time pricing and inventory management, triggering promotions when, for example, the "daily fresh" products were on the shelves for almost one entire day. Also if some product was moving slowly between central / store warehous to the stores, a replanishment would be done, all according to the sales performance.

## Store Operation

Since the products have a bar code, the employees could easily identify products and with the help of the system they could perform other tasks efficiently like receiving goods, shelving, order picking, packaging and distribution.

The store operation system was able to assign tasks to the employees that were accurate to the minute, ensuring balanced distribution of work and optimal human efficiency.

## Order Fulfillment
The product picking time for each employee was controlled by the system to stay < 3 minutes.
Transportation for the store warehouse and final package must be done under 3 minutes each as well.
To ensure delivery in 30 min the delivery man has 21 minutes to do the job.

## Logistics and distribution
Based on order time and address, the system optimized routes for the delivery man, combining different orders into delivery batches. 
This process included also information like order batch, batch category (normal / cold temperature), delivery men's familiarity with the distribution area and location at that given time.

Distribution on the Freeshippo Cloud Supermarket is done differently.
Orders would accumulate until a certain quantity and then the best route is computed. This allows the company to minimize the cost of these deliveries.


## Other Technology-Driven New Retailers (competition)

### Amazon Go

They eliminated cashier checkout ("take and go" policy)
When you take a product from the shelf the app adds that product to a virtual shopping cart.
They had problems with this approach if more than 20 people were on the store putting and taking products from the shelves too fast. They solve the problem after a year and opened to the public.

### Unattended Convenience Stores and Unattended Shelves

China wanted to compete on this market and many convenience stores of this kind entered the market. However most of them could not compete with amazon go because the products use RFID labels which require the user to scan them, making this not a proper "take and go" store.


## The Future of Freeshippo

With 5G, more data sources would be found and more bussiness oportunities would also emerge.
