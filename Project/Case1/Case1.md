## Data-Driven Product Selection
Again selected based on AliPay big data.
After 2 months of opening a store, Freeshippo traked the sales of each SKU to see what were the products that must be stocked.

> Why 2 months? \
-> It was the "conversion" time of the custumers' ordering patterns.

Freeshippo created private-label brands.
Products under the private-label brands were purchased through the "buyers system" directly to production bases.
"Daily fresh" products were purchased via the supply chain that was built with local farms.

Products of 3rd-party brands were selected via big data analysis. To make prices more reasonable they do not charge entry fees, and so on.

## Warehouse Management

2 levels:
* Central Warehouse
    * Quality inspection
    * Product Standardization
    * Live Seafood Farming
    * Products delivered in bulk on pallets
* Store Warehouse
    * Responsible to get the "daily fresh" products
    * Products delivered in small packages

Warehouse management was also built on top of Alibaba systems.
Freeshippo invented a real time pricing and inventory management, triggering promotions when, for example, the "daily fresh" products were on the shelves for almost one entire day. Also if some product was moving slowly between central / store warehous to the stores, a replanishment would be done, all according to the sales performance.

## Store Operation

Since the products have a bar code, the employees could easily identify products and with the help of the system they could perform other tasks efficiently like receiving goods, shelving, order picking, packaging and distribution.

The store operation system was able to assign tasks to the employees that were accurate to the minute, ensuring balanced distribution of work and optimal human efficiency.

## Order Fulfillment
The product picking time for each employee was controlled by the system to stay < 3 minutes.
Transportation for the store warehouse and final package must be done under 3 minutes each as well.
To ensure delivery in 30 min the delivery man has 21 minutes to do the job.

## Logistics and distribution
Based on order time and address, the system optimized routes for the delivery man, combining different orders into delivery batches. 
This process included also information like order batch, batch category (normal / cold temperature), delivery men's familiarity with the distribution area and location at that given time.

Distribution on the Freeshippo Cloud Supermarket is done differently.
Orders would accumulate until a certain quantity and then the best route is computed. This allows the company to minimize the cost of these deliveries.


## Other Technology-Driven New Retailers (competition)

### Amazon Go

They eliminated cashier checkout ("take and go" policy)
When you take a product from the shelf the app adds that product to a virtual shopping cart.
They had problems with this approach if more than 20 people were on the store putting and taking products from the shelves too fast. They solve the problem after a year and opened to the public.

### Unattended Convenience Stores and Unattended Shelves

China wanted to compete on this market and many convenience stores of this kind entered the market. However most of them could not compete with amazon go because the products use RFID labels which require the user to scan them, making this not a proper "take and go" store.


## The Future of Freeshippo

With 5G, more data sources would be found and more bussiness oportunities would also emerge.
