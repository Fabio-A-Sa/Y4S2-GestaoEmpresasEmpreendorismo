- Track for robots to deliver dishes (40 seconds average)

First issu to open a brick-and-mortar store is the site location.
Freshippo chose areas:
- with high online customers
- not always in central areas

The ultimate goal was to boost online traffic by guiding customers to shop on its app.

Customers had to use the app to make payments in offline stores. While in stores, customers could scan products and ask for home delivery. They could scan products and pay via app saving time. They also would receive via app when their food was ready if they ordered dining food.

With this approach, they could use all data from clients to improve their system. They developed extensive profiles of its customers.


It took Freshippo and Alibaba 1.5 years and 500 software engineers to develop a system suite that fully realized digital management over Freshippo's memberships, good, marketing, transactions, supply chain, and store operations.

The product selection would be based (before opening the store) on Alipay users and after it opens, would take no more than 2 months to the products fall into place.

Early 2018, Freshippo would already created 300 private-label brands (due to is R&D team). This private-label products were purchased directly from domestic or overseas production bases.

- Central (quality inspection, product standardization, and live seafood farming)
- Store

Daily fresh procusts were delivered from farms to store warehouses and the rest of the products were deliver in bulk on pallets by trucks from origin or suppliers to the central warehouse and then to the store warehouses.

Every Product had an eletronic shelf label and a barcode and employees could identify products with inteligent devices.


## Order Fulfillment

The whole order-generation process did not take more than 10 mins, due to system balanced distribution of work and technologies like conveyor belts hanging on store ceilings.

The product picking-time by each employee was controlled to stay within 3 minutes.
