# Case Study 1 - Freshippo: Data-Driven Business Model Inovation

## Introduction

Freshippo, established in Shanghai in 2016, brings together the two traditional shopping channels (supermarkets/e-commerce) along with some conveniences:

- Fresh food cooked in-store for immediate consumption;
- By scanning a QR code, users can request the app to deliver groceries to their home;
- Users can place orders online (similar to regular e-commerce platforms);

It deals with the following technologies:

- Mobile Internet;
- Cloud Computing;
- Big Data;
- Artificial Intelligence;

## Data Driven Business Model

Technology has enabled the collection of vast amounts of data. The top-level design architecture of Ali Cloud has enabled specific KPIs:

- The revenue from online transactions should exceed that from offline transactions;
- Each store should generate more than 5,000 orders per day online;
- The Freshippo app should be able to operate independently without reliance on other online traffic;
- Stores should offer 30-minute delivery while managing logistics costs effectively;

The `target customers` are women aged 20 to 45 (*white-collar workers*) who use Alipay. Data shows that this group typically has families to care for, leads a fast-paced life, and prefers fresh food. The application is an excellent choice when they are unable to visit physical stores.
They were quick to conquer the market because the seafood section in physical stores was very clean and well-presented, further boosting their reputation with the spread of rumors on social media. 

The F2 (Fast and Fresh) convenience stores, first opened in December 2017, were designed to address the time constraints of office workers waiting in lines for breakfast, lunch, and afternoon tea. Customers order through the app and then pick up and eat in the stores, without any additional wait. These stores have an area of 500m2 and serve customers located within a 500-meter radius.

Freshippo Cloud Supermarket, launched in April 2018, offered products that were not available in physical stores, delivering items based on collected data and customer needs. They provided the best value in 10 main product categories, offered overnight deliveries, and customers demanded fast deliveries only when price was not a concern.

Hexiaoma is a type of Freshippo that turns out to be dissimilar: it offers the first delivery free, up to 3 km away, but the delivery can take up to 1 hour instead of 30 minutes. Additionally, they do not offer seafood or in-site preparation foods. Customers complained about the wait time. The site uses big data from Alibaba.

Freshippo Nanxiang Store was an iteration from February 2018 that allowed for automation in in-store deliveries and food preparation:

- Customers choose their seats at the entrance;
- Scan QR code to order dishes;
- Track for robots to deliver dishes (average of 40 seconds);

However, despite the technology, several customers complained about the lack of charisma in the food - they needed more human interaction.

## Data Driven Core Competencies

Business models created from cutting-edge technologies and mature data processing capabilities.

### Data driven site selection

Data from Alipay profiles or third-party platforms is used to select the location of the store. They are interested in:

- Areas with the highest volume of transactions and highest transaction value;
- Availability of parking spaces and the cost of renting the space;
- Despite most locations being in major centers, they sometimes choose remote locations because data shows they are the homes of executives from 500 Fortune companies;

### Online Traffic Guided by Physic stores

The application enabled the conversion of the physical audience to the online platform:

- Physical stores required the use of the application for payment;
- Both the physical and online models offer the same range of products of equal quality;
- Users had to use the application even for ordering food for delivery.
- Self-checkout was available in stores;
- Customers could order food in-store and shop for other items while waiting for the notification that their food is ready;

As everything was managed through the application, it allowed for the collection of user data.

### Personalized Marketing

User data can be used for recommendations, marketing purposes, organizing parties for children of the same age in the stores, or sending promotions to specific users.

### Supply Chain Management

Supply Chain was managed using new technology and equipment. A Supply Chain Management System (SCMS) was developed around the Alibaba Cloud Platform. Deep learning techniques were employed to enhance Supply Chain operations.

## Data-Driven Product Selection

The product selection would be based (before opening the store) on Alipay users and after it opens, would take no more than 2 months to the products fall into place.

Early 2018, Freshippo would already created 300 private-label brands (due to is R&D team). Products under the private-label brands were purchased through the "buyers system" directly to production bases. "Daily fresh" products were purchased via the supply chain that was built with local farms. For example, partner with fishing rights in Alaskan waters for king crabs.

After 2 months of opening a store, Freeshippo traked the sales of each SKU to see what were the products that must be stocked. It's 2 months because it was the conversion time of the custumers' ordering patterns.

Products of 3rd-party brands were selected via big data analysis, to make prices more reasonable they do not charge entry fees, and so on.

### Warehouse Management

There is two levels of Warehouses:

- Central Warehouse
    * Quality inspection
    * Product Standardization
    * Live Seafood Farming
    * Products delivered in bulk on pallets
- Store Warehouse
    * Responsible to get the "daily fresh" products
    * Products delivered in small packages

Warehouse management was also built on top of Alibaba systems. Freeshippo invented a real time pricing and inventory management, triggering promotions when, for example, the "daily fresh" products were on the shelves for almost one entire day. Also if some product was moving slowly between central / store warehous to the stores, a replanishment would be done, all according to the sales performance.

Daily fresh procusts were delivered from farms to store warehouses and the rest of the products were deliver in bulk on pallets by trucks from origin or suppliers to the central warehouse and then to the store warehouses.

System would take into account products that were not selling so much and the central warehouse would be noticed, to make promotions or automatic replenishment.

Every Product had an eletronic shelf label and a barcode and employees could identify products with inteligent devices.

### Store Operation

Since the products have a bar code, the employees could easily identify products and with the help of the system they could perform other tasks efficiently like receiving goods, shelving, order picking, packaging and distribution.

The store operation system was able to assign tasks to the employees that were accurate to the minute, ensuring balanced distribution of work and optimal human efficiency.

### Order Fulfillment

The product picking time for each employee was controlled by the system to stay less than 3 minutes. Transportation for the store warehouse and final package must be done under 3 minutes each as well. To ensure delivery in 30 min the delivery man has 21 minutes to do the job.

The whole order-generation process did not take more than 10 mins, due to system balanced distribution of work and technologies like conveyor belts hanging on store ceilings.

The product picking-time by each employee was controlled to stay within 3 minutes.
 
### Logistics and Distribution

Based on order time and address, the system optimized routes for the delivery man, combining different orders into delivery batches. 
This process included also information like order batch, batch category (normal / cold temperature), delivery men's familiarity with the distribution area and location at that given time.

Distribution on the Freeshippo Cloud Supermarket is done differently.
Orders would accumulate until a certain quantity and then the best route is computed. This allows the company to minimize the cost of these deliveries.

## Other Technology-Driven New Retailers (Competitors)

### Amazon Go

They eliminated cashier checkout ("take and go" policy). When you take a product from the shelf the app adds that product to a virtual shopping cart.
They had problems with this approach if more than 20 people were on the store putting and taking products from the shelves too fast. They solve the problem after a year and opened to the public.

### Unattended Convenience Stores and Unattended Shelves

China wanted to compete on this market and many convenience stores of this kind entered the market. However most of them could not compete with amazon go because the products use RFID labels which require the user to scan them, making this not a proper "take and go" store.

## The Future of Freeshippo

With 5G, more data sources would be found and more bussiness oportunities would also emerge.
